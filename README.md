## What does it do

This Python script will generate a graph with the member accounts of your AWS Organization.

## This project uses

- Python3
- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [AWS cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

## Where does the information comes from

The information that will be used to generate a graph like the example below, will be generated by using the AWS cli.

## Get started

- [Install AWS Cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Install Graphviz

```bash
pip3 install pygraphviz
```

## How to use it

### Generate a file with dummy data for testing
```bash
python3 generate_output.py > output.json
```

**Result example:**
```json
{
    "Accounts": [

        {
            "Id": "000000000001",
            "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::999999999999:account/o-0rgan1zat1/000000000001",
            "Email": "account-000000000001@example.com",
            "Name": "Account 000000000001",
            "Status": "ACTIVE",
            "JoinedMethod": "CREATED",
            "JoinedTimestamp": "2019-11-18T19:27:04.322000-05:00"
        },
...
        {
            "Id": "000000000008",
            "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::999999999999:account/o-0rgan1zat1/000000000008",
            "Email": "account-000000000008@example.com",
            "Name": "Account 000000000008",
            "Status": "ACTIVE",
            "JoinedMethod": "CREATED",
            "JoinedTimestamp": "2009-07-15T04:37:15.196000-04:00"
        }
    ]
}
```
*You can find an output example file [here](output.json-example).*

### Plot an AWS Organizations Graph based on the dummy file you have created
```bash
python3 organizations.py
```

### Get your AWS Organizations information and save to a file

You will need read access to your Root account in order to gather the required information.

```bash
aws organizations list-accounts --output json > output.json
```

### Plot an AWS Organizations Graph based on your Organization information
```bash
python3 organizations.py
```

## Clean up
No AWS resources will be created so no clean up is needed.


## Notes
Running this code will create AWS resources in your account that might not be included in the free tier.
